# DISPLAYING-UART-DATA-ON-7-SEGMENT-DISPLAY
This Arduino sketch controls a 7-segment display using digital pins 2–9.
Numbers are sent from the Serial Monitor, and the Arduino displays the corresponding digit by activating the correct segments.
Each digit (0–9) is defined in a separate function, allowing clear and modular control of the display.
Additional commands enable turning off all segments and running simple countdown or animation sequences.
